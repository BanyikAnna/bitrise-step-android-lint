# Android Lint

The lint tool checks your Android project source files for potential bugs and optimization improvements for correctness, security, performance, usability, accessibility, and internationalization.

## Improve Your Code with Lint

In addition to testing your Android application to ensure that it meets its functional requirements, it's important to ensure that your code has no structural problems. Poorly structured code can impact the reliability and efficiency of your Android apps and make your code harder to maintain. For example, if your XML resource files contain unused namespaces, this takes up space and incurs unnecessary processing. Other structural issues, such as use of deprecated elements or API calls that are not supported by the target API versions, might lead to code failing to run correctly.

### Overview

Android Studio provides a code scanning tool called lint that can help you to identify and correct problems with the structural quality of your code without your having to execute the app or write test cases. Each problem detected by the tool is reported with a description message and a severity level, so that you can quickly prioritize the critical improvements that need to be made. Also, you can lower the severity level of a problem to ignore issues that are not relevant to your project, or raise the severity level to highlight specific problems.
